                    <br>
                    Making money is not the goal of business. The goal is to create a social impact, to help people and solve problems.
                    <br>
                    We have to go beyond the usual definition of entrepreneurship. We need to think about creating social businesses that can change the world.
                    <br>
                    When women are given the opportunity, they take charge, and they have the ability to solve their own problems and to bring positive change in the world.
                    <br>
                    A social business is a business whose goal is to address a social problem, not to maximize profit for the owner. It is designed to create social benefits for the people, while being financially self-sustaining.</p>
